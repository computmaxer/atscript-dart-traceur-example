=============================

> Example using Traceur to compile AtScript into Dart and JS.

This was created looking at the AngularJS build process. `tools/transpiler/` came directly from the AngularJS repository. Presumably this functionality will make it into stable Traceur at some point eliminating the need to include that directory.

## Try it out
```bash
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

Now check the `build` directory for both the Dart and JS output.
